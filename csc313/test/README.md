## 💡 Study Tips

1. **Practice, Practice, Practice**: Especially K-maps and number conversions
2. **Understand, Don't Memorize**: Know WHY things work, not just HOW
3. **Draw Diagrams**: Visualize circuits and logic flows
4. **Use Truth Tables**: When in doubt, make a truth table
5. **Check Your Work**: Verify answers with simple test cases
6. **Time Yourself**: Practice under test conditions
7. **Study Groups**: Explain concepts to others to reinforce learning
8. **Take Breaks**: Don't cram for hours without rest
9. **Sleep Well**: Your brain needs rest to consolidate learning
10. **Stay Confident**: You've prepared well!
