## ✅ CHAPTER 1: Digital Systems and Binary Numbers

### ✅ 1.1 Digital Systems
**STATUS**: ✓ Covered in chapter1-digital-systems.md
**KEY CONCEPTS**:
- Digital vs Analog (light switch vs dimmer analogy)
- Why binary? (Two stable states)
- Reliability and programmability

**DEEP UNDERSTANDING**: Digital systems use discrete values (0 and 1) because electronic circuits have two stable voltage states. This makes them reliable and easy to implement with transistors.
