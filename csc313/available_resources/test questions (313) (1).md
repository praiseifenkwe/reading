e following is NOT ntJE?

he Z's complement has advantage over I complement of being easier to implement by digital The I's complement requires two arithmetic additions when an end-carry carry occurs.

- During subtraction Of two numbers the 2's complement has advantage over I's complementin operation is required.
- The I's complement has a disadvantage Of possessing two arithmetic zeroes. e rhe complement is equivalent to a logical inversion operation.
